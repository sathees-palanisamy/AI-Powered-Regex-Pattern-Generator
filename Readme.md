🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues & Solutions
Issue	Solution
"GEMINI_API_KEY not found"	Ensure .env file exists in backend directory with valid API key
Port 3000 already in use	Run npx kill-port 3000 or change port in server.js
Port 3001 already in use	Run npx kill-port 3001 or Vite will automatically use next available
Module not found errors	Run npm install in both backend and client directories
CORS errors	Backend includes CORS headers for development on localhost:3001
